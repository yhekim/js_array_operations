User story;

  - Display UI with movie select, screen, seats, legend & seat info
  - User can select a movie/price
  - User can select/deselect seats
  - User can not select occupied seats
  - Number of seats and price will update
  - Save seats, movie and price to localStorage so that UI is still populated on refresh

ðŸ”¥ You donâ€™t need to create a new template for this project, you can use [Movie_Seat_Booking_App](https://github.com/clarusway/clarusway-full-stack-9-21/tree/main/javascript/projects/005%20-%20Movie_Seat_Booking_App(JS-05)) template for html and css. We will be concerned in javascript side.
